# My portfolio

## Things to highlight

I need to showcase my expertise in full stack application development
- code i write is clean, clear and easy to maintain which i great if you already have a tech team
for me its easier to adhere to existing patterns and i can help you find any chinks in the armor
- i can solve complex problems which makes me an ideal candidate if you are from a non technical background

I also need some working applications to showcase on my portfolio

I need a section to highlight ninana technologies private limited
I need to say that all my projects are deployed under the banner of ninana technologies
- bharpet
- darshan
- holygrain
- nivedan and nirvahan

I can also showcase anant's website and the shopify store for hashtag-dna

I need a section for other ideas as well
basically my journey till now

The showcase needs to be dynamic, the user should not have to scroll, the site should automatically guide the user, like a tour.
It has to be an experience.
